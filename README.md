## FileBox
Simple but usable file upload service that is a easy and self hostable way to host files on a server yourself

## Usage
- Install GoLang from [https://go.dev/dl/](https://go.dev/dl/)
- Move into this folder and run `go build .` to compile an executable for your operating system
- Make sure the `accets` folder is located in the directory with the executable (this contains html files and images)
- Run the program and access your new FileBox instance!
